# fraud-detection-ml
End-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting financial frauds

# Fraud Detection ML Project 🕵️‍♂️💸

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- SMOTE oversampling to handle class imbalance
- Model training and evaluation (F1, ROC-AUC)
- SHAP explainability
- Saved trained model for deployment

## 📁 Project Structure
- `fraud_detection.ipynb` – Main notebook
- `xgboost_fraud_model.joblib` – Trained model
- `scaler.joblib` – Scaler used for prediction
- `images/` – ROC, SHAP plots
- `README.md` – This file

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost
- SHAP, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📊 Results
Achieved 95%+ precision and recall using XGBoost with 100K training samples.
